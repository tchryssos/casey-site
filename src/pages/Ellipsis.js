					THE ACTIONS

				<Heading>
					Build a Wix site that doesnâ€™t look like a Wix site
				</Heading>
				<Spacer />
				<Body>
					It was important that this site be able to scale with the team after my 1 week stint with them. Because their existing site was built in Wix we stuck with that platform so they could easily make changes down the line.

				<Heading>
					Expand the brand guidelines for web
				</Heading>
				<Spacer />
				<Body>
					Ellipsis Health had just created a new logo and color palette for their brand. While this needed to be present in the site designs, there was not a lot of other guidance on visual so I worked with the team to grow their style guide for web.

				<SubHeading>
					The Sound Wave
				</SubHeading>
				<Spacer />
				<Body>Since one of Ellipsis Health&apos;s goals is to establish speech as a vital sign, the sound wave became an important design element as well. In graphic treatments, it is often combined with the ellipsis circles, but I also used it to help create heirarchy in our typography.</Body>
				<Image src={SoundWave} size="full" />
				<SubHeading>
					Iconography
				</SubHeading>
				<Spacer />
				<Body>Because we didn't have any existing icons ready to use, I created some to enhance certain ideas brought in the site.</Body>
				<Image src={Icons} size="full" />

				<Heading>
					Speak to all of our users
				</Heading>
				<Spacer />
				<Body>
					While this project started as a single-page site, it quickly grew beyond a simple splash page as we thought about the information each of our users are looking for.
