					Build a Wix site that doesnâ€™t look like a Wix site
				</Heading>
				<Body>
					It was important that this site be able to scale with the team after my 1 week stint with them. Because their existing site was built in Wix we stuck with that platform so they could easily make changes down the line.

				<Heading>
					Expand the brand guidelines for web
				</Heading>
				<Body>
					Ellipsis Health had just created a new logo and color palette for their brand. While this needed to be present in the site designs, there was not a lot of other guidance on visual so I worked with the team to grow their style guide for web.
