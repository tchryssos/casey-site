					In my reserach, most shoppers will filter directly down the category

					With a background in graphic design, I felt fairly comfortable

					Coming into Design Lab, I wanted to learn more about how to execute

					potential users and going through the research process helped me to
					feel confident in my decision making and back it up with data that put
					the user at the center.

				<Body>
					This project helped me understand just how much detail goes into any
					online shopping experience. Filling in my prototypes with real content
					was informative in planning for situations like different length
					product names and reviews, showing sizes and colors that are out of
					stock, and creating different states for filters and drop-downs.

				<SubHeading>Working Remotely</SubHeading>

				<Body>
					Even though some of my research and testing plans involved processes
					that would ideally be hands-on, I was able to adapt most of them to be
					executed virtually. I used zoom to facilitate card-sorting via a
					Trello board and also to observe participants interacting with my
					Figma prototype. I used Maze to help other students with their testing
					and learned a lot about planning for what is feasible and being
					flexible.
