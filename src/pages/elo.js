				<Body>
					This project was something that a friend started as a personal project so him and his coworkers could track their rankings while they played Super Smash Bros. Below is the first very simple prototype he built. After using it, we decided we wanted to make it available for multiple games and multiple users.

					After a few iterations, we recruited our friend who is a backend developer to round out our product team and help us execute on a more robust user experience. Here we created a brand new product roadmap, mapping out all of the features we needed for an MVP.

					For this project we explored 3 different visual directions. One that used relied heavily on the dark mode aesthetic we saw a lot in the space, one that used a blue mode to keep the accessibily of dark mode but allo wus to stand out and one that went entirely out of the box.
